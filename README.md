# Titanic Survival Prediction üö¢üí°  

## Overview  
This project aims to predict the **survival** of Titanic passengers using machine learning techniques. The dataset was obtained from **Kaggle**, and **extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)** was performed to extract meaningful insights before training the model. The final model achieved an accuracy of **82%**.

## Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)  
- **Size:** 891 samples with 11 features  
- **Features:** Passenger details such as age, gender, class, and fare price  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Collection:** Loaded dataset from Kaggle  
2. **EDA:**  
   - Analyzed missing values and handled data cleaning  
   - Explored relationships between features and survival rate  
   - Visualized data trends using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`  
3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created new features for better predictions  
   - Encoded categorical variables  
   - Scaled numerical data  
4. **Model Training:**  
   - Applied machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
   - Optimized hyperparameters for better performance  
5. **Evaluation:** Achieved **82% accuracy**, validated using test data  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** üêç  
- **Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** Data visualization  
- **Scikit-Learn:** Model training and evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab:** Development environment  

## Results  
- **Accuracy:** 82%  
- Identified key factors influencing survival on the Titanic

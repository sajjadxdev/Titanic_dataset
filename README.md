# Oral Cancer Prediction Model ü¶∑üìä  

## Overview  
This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** for predicting **oral cancer** with an accuracy of **82%**. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing clinical data. The dataset used for training was obtained from **Kaggle** and underwent **extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)** for insights and feature selection.

## Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- **Size:** 892 samples and 11 features  
- **Features:** Clinical and demographic attributes related to oral cancer  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Collection:** Dataset imported from Kaggle  
2. **EDA:**  
   - Analyzed data distribution and relationships  
   - Visualized patterns and trends using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`  
   - Handled missing values and performed feature selection  
3. **Model Training:** Applied machine learning techniques to predict oral cancer.  
4. **Evaluation:** Achieved **82% accuracy**, validated on test data.

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** üêç  
- **Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** Data visualization  
- **Scikit-Learn:** Model training and evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab:** Development environment  

## Results  
- **Accuracy:** 82%  
- Early detection potential for oral cancer using predictive analysis  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository
